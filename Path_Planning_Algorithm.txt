###Talk about how to run Hybrid Astar algorithm for path planning and simulate in 2d view

#Github: https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/HybridAStarTrailer
#Paper: Practical Search Techniques in Path Planning for Autonomous Driving

I. C++ for normal car
## Steps
1. Under folder /home/yosun/Desktop/Path_Planning_Algorithm/HybridAstar_car_cplusplus/HybridAstar_truck_cplusplus/src

2. Open a command and run make
$ make

## Results
$ cd simulation/
$ python animation.py //ROS coordinate system
$ python animation_carla.py //CARLA coordinate system
It will run as a gif and save image to result folder

II. C++ for trailer truck
## Steps
1. Under folder /home/yosun/Desktop/Path_Planning_Algorithm/HybridAstar_truck_trailer_cplusplus/src

2. Open a command and run make
$ make

## Results
$ cd simulation/
$ python animation.py //ROS coordinate system
